== Basic demo for using KStream and KTable as inputs on the same StreamListener method

This is an application that demonstrates how you can bind to both KStream and KTable in a single StreamListener method.
Both KStream and KTable are backed by separate topics.

=== Running the app:

This application is intended to run from an IDE as this contains multiple Boot applications (drivers for testing in addition to the main app)

Make sure that you have Kafka running (The app expects to run on default ports on localhost. If that is not the case, change the configuraion in the yaml file)

Start the application: KstreamKtableSampleApplication

Then start either of the 2 drivers provided: SendToStreamTopic or SendToTableTopic

Watch the console on the main application. It simply logs the fact that the method was activated through either of the drivers and print the key/value sent to the topic.
